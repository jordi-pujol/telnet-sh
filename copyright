This is the telnet-sh, a telnet client that provides automatization, 
developed by Jordi Pujol <jordipujolp@gmail.com>.

telnet-sh is a tiny telnet client written in Bash, suitable to be 
installed on minimal computers or routers that don't have a telnet 
program, like the OpenWRT ones.

Does not implement the complete Telnet protocol, for example the OPEN 
command is not available, so we must specify the host as an option in 
the command line.

Also have packaged it for Debian, it's interesting for the reduced size 
of this program and the automatization posibilities.
